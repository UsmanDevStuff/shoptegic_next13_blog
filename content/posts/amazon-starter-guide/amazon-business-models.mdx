To date, over half of Amazon’s retail sales come from third-party (3P) sellers (rather than from Amazon itself). 

A big part of this growth comes from the flexibility Amazon offers its sellers.

There are six popular Amazon business models sellers use to sell products on the platform (detailed below), and Jungle Scout’s survey of over 2,600 Amazon sellers reveals the breakdown of which business models most Amazon sellers use to sell on Amazon.

 * Private Label: 54%*
 * Wholesale: 26%
 * Retail Arbitrage: 25%
 * Online Arbitrage: 24%
 * Dropshipping: 17%
 * Handmade: 8%
