## Introduction

Creating an Amazon selling account is the first step in getting your products out there and making money. In this blog post, we'll walk you through the process of setting up an Amazon seller account, from signing up to listing your products. We'll also discuss the different types of accounts available and the fees associated with each. By the end of this post, you'll have a better understanding of how to create an Amazon seller account and be ready to start selling!

## Creating a Amazon Seller Account

Once you’ve figured out what you plan on selling on Amazon, you’ll need to go through the Amazon seller registration process, which is really quite simple.

1. **Click [Here](https://sell.amazon.com) or visit `https://sell.amazon.com`**
![Amazon seller page{{ w: 700, h: 393, cap: "Amazon Seller Page." }}](/images/amazon-starter-guide/amazon-seller-page.webp)

2. **Click on the “Pricing” tab**

Before clicking the “Sign up” button and beginning the process, let’s first compare Amazon’s selling plans. Go to the “Pricing” tab and click on “Compare selling plans.” This will bring you to a comparison page to see the differences between an individual and a professional seller account.

<Callout type="note">

If you click on the orange ‘Sign up’ button, you’ll immediately be taken to the registration page for a professional seller. The ‘See pricing’ link, on the other hand, shows you the difference between the individual and professional accounts, and allows you to choose which registration you want.

3. **Choose between an individual or professional seller account**

When it comes to Amazon’s seller plans, you have two options: [professional and individual](https://shop-tegic.com/posts/amazon-starter-guide/individual-vs-professional).

![i-vs-p{{ w: 700, h: 393, cap: "Amazon Individual vs Professional." }}](/images/amazon-starter-guide/i-vs-p.webp)

If you’re going to sell more than 40 products per month, then signing up as a ‘professional’ is your best bet. Even if you’re selling as a hobby and don’t consider yourself to be a professional, this plan will help you save money. 

But, if you’re planning to sell on a smaller scale (ie. fewer than 40 units per month), select the individual plan.

Though keep in mind that if you choose the individual plan, your products will not be eligible for the Buy Box and you won’t have the ability to advertise your products on Amazon. 

<Callout type="note">

When you sign up for the professional account, you will be charged $39.99/month for the first month. For any months that you do not have any active listings, you will not be charged the $39.99 for that month. Once you have an active product for sale, you will be charged again.

</Callout>

4. **Enter your email and select ‘Create a New Account’**

Once you’ve chosen the seller plan that is right for you, the following window will appear where you’ll be asked to enter your email address and a password (of your choosing) for your seller account.

When you’re done, click the ‘Next’ button.
![a-signin{{ w: 700, h: 393, cap: "Amazon Sign in Page." }}](/images/amazon-starter-guide/a-signin.webp)

This will take you to a second screen stating you must enter a verification code sent to your email. This is Amazon’s way of verifying the email you entered.

Once you enter the correct code, you’ll be automatically taken to this screen:
![a1{{ w: 700, h: 393, cap: "Amazon" }}](/images/amazon-starter-guide/a1.webp)

Amazon will let you know what you’ll need to complete your registration:

 - Valid government issued ID or passport
 - Recent bank account or credit card statement 
 - Chargeable credit card 
 - Mobile phone number

5. **Choose your ‘Business location’ and ‘Business type’**

The next step in the Amazon seller registration process is to share the following information:
  * **Your business location**: This is the country in which your business is located. It’s extremely important that this is accurate, as Amazon will be verifying it (see step 10).
  * **Your business type**: You’ll be able to choose your business entity from the following options (most fall into the ‘Privately-owned’ category):
      * State-owned business
      * Publicly-owned business
      * Privately-owned business
      * Charity
      * None, I am an individual

If you don’t have a business formed just yet, choose “None, I am an individual.” If you choose this, Amazon will ask for your full name in the next step.

  * **Your full name**: Make sure you enter your first, middle, and last name.

Then, click the ‘Agree and continue’ button.

6. **Enter your personal information**

From there, you’ll be asked to provide Amazon with a number of personal details. This includes a form of identification (either your passport number or your driver’s license).

To move onto the next step, you will need to verify your phone number through a text or call. When you enter the PIN you received from Amazon, your number will be verified.  

Make sure all of your information is correct before moving on.

![a4{{ w: 700, h: 393, cap: "Input your information" }}](/images/amazon-starter-guide/a4.webp)
![a5{{ w: 700, h: 393, cap: "Input your information" }}](/images/amazon-starter-guide/a5.webp)

When you’ve entered everything, click on ‘Next’ at the bottom of the screen.

7. **Enter your billing information**

Your next step will be to provide Amazon with your billing information. This includes a valid bank account number and a valid credit card number. 
![a6{{ w: 700, h: 393, cap: "Input your information" }}](/images/amazon-starter-guide/a6.webp)
![a7{{ w: 700, h: 393, cap: "Input your information" }}](/images/amazon-starter-guide/a7.webp)
![a8{{ w: 700, h: 393, cap: "Input your information" }}](/images/amazon-starter-guide/a8.webp)
![a9{{ w: 700, h: 393, cap: "Input your information" }}](/images/amazon-starter-guide/a9.webp)
8. **Add the information for your product(s) and Amazon store**
After you supply your credit card information and it has been validated, you’ll be asked a few questions about your Amazon store and the products you plan to sell.

To move onto the next phase of the Amazon seller registration process, you’ll need to answer the following:

  * The name of your Amazon store (don’t think too much about this, you can change it in the future)
  * Whether or not you have UPC codes for your product(s) (if you’re not sure, just click “Yes”)
  * If you have any diversity certifications
  * If you are the manufacturer and/or brand owner of the product(s) you’re selling
    *  If you click ‘Yes’ or ‘Some of them’ you’ll be asked: Do you own a government-registered trademark for the branded products you want to sell on Amazon?

![a10{{ w: 700, h: 393, cap: "Input your information" }}](/images/amazon-starter-guide/a10.webp)
Click the ‘Next’ button after you’ve provided the answers to those questions. 
9. **Identity verification**

Next, you’ll be asked to verify your identity by uploading images of your ID (license or passport) and a bank statement.
![a11{{ w: 700, h: 393, cap: "Input your information" }}](/images/amazon-starter-guide/a11.webp)

After you upload your documents, click Submit.

After submitting all of your documents, you will need to complete an Identity Verification via video call with an Amazon associate. This is so they can verify all of your documents and personal information you provided. 

Unfortunately, this is now part of the process so we suggest doing it as soon as possible so you can start selling products on Amazon. You may have an option to take a call at the end of your application. If you cannot at that time, you can schedule an appointment for a future date and time.

![a12{{ w: 700, h: 393, cap: "Input your information" }}](/images/amazon-starter-guide/a12.webp)

Once you’re verified, you’re in!

To be on the safe side, we recommend setting up 2-step verification on your account, for increased security. But, once your identity and business information have been verified, all you need to do to get started is to log into https://sellercentral.amazon.com. 

And this is what your seller account home screen will look like (without any sales yet, of course).
